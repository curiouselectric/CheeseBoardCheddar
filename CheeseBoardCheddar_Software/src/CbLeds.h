/*! \brief Wrapper around Adafruit_NeoPixel with Millis() correction
 *
 *  When the Adafruit_NeoPixel.show() member is called interrupts are 
 *  temporarily disabled to allow the precise timing required when
 *  sending data out to the LEDs. This has a few side-effects,
 *  including a drift in the timer which is used by millis().
 *
 *  This is usually a small effect, but when LEDs are updated very
 *  frequently the offset can add up and become noticable. In one 
 *  application, the author noticed the value of millis being 50% 
 *  slower than real time!
 *
 *  This class is a simple sub-class of the Adafruit_NeoPixel class
 *  which estimates the offset to the millis() timer, and updates the
 *  offset for the Millis() call.
